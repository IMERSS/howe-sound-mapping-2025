## Introduction

## Howe Sound's vascular plant diversity

Over one thousand vascular plant species are known to occur within the Átl’ḵa7tsem/Howe Sound Biosphere, represented by `r nrow(plants)` occurrence records. This diverse flora spans nine biogeoclimatic units, from lowland coastal western hemlock forests and associated woodland communities to high elevation subalpine and alpine plant communities.

Explore the region's flora by selecting from the biogeoclimatic units displayed on the map:

* Alpine Tundra zone ([CMAunp](#region:CMAunp))
* Mountain Hemlock zone ([MHmm1](#region:MHmm1), [MHmm2](#region:MHmm2))
* Coastal Western Hemlock zone ([CWHdm](#region:CWHdm), [CWHds1](#region:CWHds1), [CWHms1](#region:CWHms1), [CWHvm1](#region:CWHvm1), [CWHvm2](#region:CWHvm2), [CWHxm1](#region:CWHxm1))

## History of collection activities within the region

While Indigenous knowledge of Átl’ḵa7tsem's plant life traces back to time immemorial, Western scientific documentation of the region's flora dates to 1897, with the early collection efforts of James Anderson and Albert J. Hill. Over the last century and a half, early efforts to document the regional flora were most concentrated in the 1920s, and from the 1960s through the 1980s, before expanding significantly in the 21st century with the advent of iNaturalist, with many thousands of observations made by community members through the <a href = "https://www.squamishenvironment.ca/projects/biodiversity-squamish/">Howe Sound Biodiversity project</a>.

## Community science contributions

Through the combined efforts of `r length(unique(plants$recordedBy))` individuals, the Átl’ḵa7tsem/Howe Sound naturalist community has now documented a total of `r nrow(plant.summary)` vascular plant species. Based on search efforts over the last decade, `r round((nrow(confirmed)/(nrow(confirmed)+nrow(reported))*100), digits = 0)` percent of the historically reported plant diversity has been confirmed and `r nrow(new)` new species reports added to the list. Community members have now documented `r round((nrow(observed)/(nrow(plant.summary))*100), digits = 0)` percent of the plant diversity known to the region on iNaturalist.

## Top contributions to our knowledge of the regional plant diversity

You can contribute to this growing record of the regional plant diversity by submitting your observations to the [Atl'ka7tsem Howe Sound Biosphere Region iNaturalist project.](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/atl-ka7tsem-howe-sound-biosphere-region) Here, you can browse photos of some of the most commonly documented plants, as well as recent observations and top observers across the region, based on [iNaturalist](http://inaturalist.org/) data.

## Vascular plant diversity within Howe Sound's protected areas

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="1024px"}
#width instructions from https://stackoverflow.com/a/41371132
source("scripts/Protected_areas.R")

native.plants <- read.csv("outputs/AHSBR_native_vascular_plant_species.csv")
protected.plants <- read.csv("outputs/AHSBR_protected_native_vascular_plant_species.csv")

protectedAreaMap
protected.area.plot 
```

<div class="data-pane">
*Map 4. Protected Areas*
</div>

Based on our current knowledge, `r round(nrow(protected.plants)/nrow(native.plants)*100)` percent of the native plant diversity known to Átl’ḵa7tsem/Howe Sound has been reported within protected areas. While this preliminary evaluation is limited due to biases in sampling effort and other deficiencies in the data, it represents a starting point for a more thorough assessment of progress being made toward goals of conserving our regional habitat diversity. Please help improve our understanding of the distribution of vascular plants and other biodiversity the region by reporting your observations to the [Atl'ka7tsem Howe Sound Biosphere Region iNaturalist project.](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/atl-ka7tsem-howe-sound-biosphere-region)
